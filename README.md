# DINE HARD

Welcome to Dine Hard! This application is a CMS-style review site where users can read and publish restaurant reviews as well as comment on existint reviews. Users can also search for their favorite restaurants based on location.

## Technology

The application utilizes Handlebars.js as the templating language, MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database, and the express-session npm package for authentication. It also utilizes the Starry Rating npm package library as well as TripAdvisor rapid API for search queries.

## Funtionality

Users can expect the following app functionality:

* When they initially visit the site, they are presented with a homepage that displays recent restaurant reviews and a search bar for searching restaurants by location.
* If they click on any of the reviews, they are taken to that post's page where they can read the review and place a comment.
* If they would like to publish a review, they can click on "login" in the navigation, where they can either sign up as a new user or log in if they are an existing user.
* When they log in or sign up, they are taken to a dashboard page where they can see their reviews and add/or add new reviews.
* From the dashboard page they click on any of their existing reviews and either edit them or delete them.
* Finally, the user can log out from the navigation.
